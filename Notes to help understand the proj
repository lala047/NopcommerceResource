I put the Excel (data) Path in the DataProvider class
 
 All the page classes extended the BasePage which contains paegfactory. initElements and this.driver=driver;
 
 All the Test cases extended the Base Class
 
 In Login test case, the test method (public void loginTest() throws InterruptedException {) does not have parameters
 
 In the DDT test case, the test method (public void loginTestDDT(String user,String pwd,String exp) throws InterruptedException{) does HAVE parameters
 
 Delete this ( <!DOCTYPE suite SYSTEM "https://testng.org/testng-1.0.dtd">) from the xml file if there is an error showing up anywhere on your xml
 
 
 
 NOTE
 -----
 -No compartment for Drivers
  -No compartment for ReadConfig as there is a method in the BaseClass ( rb=ResourceBundle.getBundle("config")) that reads Config.Properties file
